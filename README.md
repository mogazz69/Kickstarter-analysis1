# Kickstarter-analysis1
# Overview of the project

> The main goal of this project is to help Louiseâ€™s play *Fever* reach its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

> Through the use of excel I was able to parse through the sample data of other Kickstarter projects over the years and with various budgets and gather useful info on what can make or break a Kickstarter project. Some of the issues that I encountered are related with constant and repetitive steps that I had to do for me to organise the data. One of these examples was writing the *countif* statements and having to write the same line repeatedly.

### Results

1. Based on outcomes by launch dates:
From the graph "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch" We can see that best time to launch a summer play is in the summer months of May to July. Also, the worst months were the fall and winter months from September to December.

2. Outcomes vs Goals:
surprisingly the most successful outcomes were the ones with the least amount pledged mainly in the less than 1000 bracket.



# Summary
One of the limitations of this data set is the small sample size. In addition, a box and whisker graph could provide some onsite on what potential outliers are in the data set.
